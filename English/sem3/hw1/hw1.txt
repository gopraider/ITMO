The dish I love cooking schnitzel,which is made from chicken. The recipe is very simple.
At first you should cut the chicken fiilet into medium pieces. Next step is to beat the fillet. Then you should take some eggs and mix them,
also you should take breadcrumbs into another plate. Then you should take the piece of fillet, put into eggs then put into breadcrumbs and repeat these action 3-4 times.
Don't forget some lemon juice into breadcrumbs!. Last step is to fried pieces. when you will serve this dish, don't forget 
to add  some cucumbers and red pepper. These vegetables will add a pleasant taste to the harmony of the dish.
